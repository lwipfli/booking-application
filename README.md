# Room Booking POC Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Notes:

Compile:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

Force Compile:

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

Run tests:

```
npx hardhat test
```

Clean cache

```
npx hardhat clean
```

Check contract sizes after compilation:

```
npx hardhat size-contracts
```

Check contract sizes without compilation:

```
npx hardhat size-contracts --no-compile
```

Run Example indexing script

```
npx hardhat run ./scripts/eventIndexExample.js
```
